Hello!

My name is William Halliburton and this project is my attempt to share
the little bit of Common Lisp knowledge and tricks that I have picked
up over the years and hopefully learn something myself in the
process. Oh, and to have fun too!

This academy project is to be read using github or a git viewer of
your choice as much discussion will take place in the git commit log.

Peace and happy hacking,
Will
